## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivaion to complete this study guide was to learn the basics of HTML, CSS & Javascript so I can have a certain amount of familiarity before starting the bootcamp.
- I built this project in order to learn how to utilize the programs & resources that have been given to me, gain a certain familiarity on the programs that I'm learning about and also learn how apply these programs in a class and working environment.
- This problem allowed me to solve the puzzle on the building blocks on how to create a web application and helped me solve and figure out how to use the resouce git.
- I learned that building a web application is very time consuming and takes a lot of focus power and personal attentiveness. Also I learned how to use Git and get familiar with Web programs I already know or haven't learned yet.
